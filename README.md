## Plans
### PART I: Software Neuromorphic Computing
This part specially discuss the software spiking neural network and dynamical system. 
Discusses the simulation of the nervous system in microscopic world and a macroscopic world.
This part will cover **neuron models**, **synapse models**, **network structures**, **training algorithms**, **simulation algorithms**, **dynamical system** and more. 
The content will cover both the discussion of simulation in the **classical case** as well as simulation in the **quantum case**.

### PART II: Dynamics Analysis

### PART III: Hardware Neuromorphic Computing

### PART IV: Applications

## Current Status

- **Project Status**: 
  - In writing <u>(Neuron Model Part)</u>
- **PDF Updates**: 
  - Periodically updated with the latest content
